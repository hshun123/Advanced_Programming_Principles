### All scores

(Note, this was re-generated on Saturday, May 18 to include the correct possible total percentage including extra credit.  It was incorrectly left at 80.83%, from the time before the final was completed.  It is now set to 100.83%, which is the maximum amount available.  This did not affect any actual scores and thus has no effect on letter grades.)
